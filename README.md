# Dashboard_Project
Welcome to my very first dashboard project using PowerBI. 

I have an interest in Cyber Data Science, so I was experimenting with making a dashboard that would provide a basic overview of the state of a given network at a fictional healthcare organization. 

There will be more projects to come, but for now, feel free to clone this repository and check out the dashboards by opening the "CyberDashboard-PartA.pbix" and the "CyberDashboard-PartB.pbix" files.

CyberDashboard-PartA.pbix is based off of data that came from the Department of Health and Human Services Breach Portal Reporting Tool (https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf). This dasboard was meant to be more of a promotional tool that would show a variety of breach statistics related to the healthcare industry. It was meant to be used as a sales tool that would demonstrate why a Network Intrusion Detection System is important.

CyberDashboard-PartB.pbix was built to simulate a dashboard setup that would handle real-time streaming data, and would theoretically detect live attacks and other anomalous behaviors going on in a given network. Since I was just a student when I made this, I did not have access to live streaming data, so it was created using the UNSW-NB15 Dataset, which is used to generate a hybrid of real, modern normal activities and network attack behaviors, found here: https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/

Since a comprehensive security plan would include some kind of corporate infosec training for employees, I also included some tiles (in the top right corner of Dashboard B) that would show the progress on current team training initiatives at this ficticious healthcare company.

That's all for now! Enjoy the dashboards!
